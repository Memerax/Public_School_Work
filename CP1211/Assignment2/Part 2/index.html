                Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan.
                Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston),
                an underpaid, overqualified, and dispirited high-school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a
                recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of crime and partners with a
                former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and distribute methamphetamine to secure his
                family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld.
                The show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a
                total of 62 episodes.

                Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, between 2008 and 2010, Breaking Bad follows Walter White,
                a modest high school chemistry teacher who transforms into a ruthless kingpin in the local
                methamphetamine drug trade, driven to financially provide for his family after being diagnosed with
                inoperable lung cancer. Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student Jesse
                Pinkman in a rolling meth lab, Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger batches of special
                blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand. Walter takes on the name "Heisenberg"
                to mask his identity. Because of his drug-related activities, Walter eventually finds himself at
                odds with his family, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) through his brother-in-law Hank
                Schrader,
                the local gangs, and the Mexican drug cartels (including their regional distributors), putting him and
                his family's lives at risk.
